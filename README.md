## Random notes, mainly for me

### Code maintenance / small changes
- test to see if not using JSDOM improves performance
	- I need to stop using JSDOM
- fix [xml request](https://github.com/ElderINTERalliance/WikiRaces2021/blob/3d731bdac930a36299f17b73827c23e2dd1e2c54/src/game/game_static/client.js#L13)
- set up nojs and IE support
- add more padding to the bottom of the navbar

### Design:
- encode urls properly
- add loading icon behind Iframe
- see if I can do anything to make http requests less intensive
	-  http/2
- send POST requests on level finish
- create homepage where you can set your name in a cookie
	- add this to the post request
- set up mongodb
- Make homepage to view submissions
	- simplified view -> click for more details


Limitations:
 - Design I know will work: Shortest time wins
 - Design I want: get shortest time, and shortest number of links.
 - If I'm hosting this on my home network, I am not going to be able to host all of the Wikipedia pages due to network limitations.
	 - Can I scrape the wiki pages and modify them so they set window variables?
         - This would mean I can host all of the pages with github's free hosting, and just host the database on my personal server.

Other aspects:
 - I want a leaderboard -> need to host a website
 - I want to tell who won immediately -> I need to host a website
 - I want a timer to count down to event start

Basic game structure:
  - Add horizontal history view in bottom bar
  - Before game starts, show timer
  - As game starts: Log Date object to cookies? 
  - Game end is found when the iframe location is equal to the target URL
  - At game end, (StartTime - CurrentTime) is submitted to the database as the time taken, along with a user entered name.
	  - (we should ask they use their real names.)

To do: 
 - Add link to go back to main page when we run out of time.
 - Disable opening links in new tab?
 - Nicely comment everything.
 - get a good server hosting solution.
 - Look into port forwarding with NGINX 
 - Create homepage
 - Create game client
	 - Be able to detect what webpage the user is on.
		 - How to get info from url?
	 - Time till completion should work by storing a date object at game start, and getting the delta at game over.
 - Create backend (hopefully something better than just a JSON file, but we'll see.)

Online games we can clone:
  - Wikispedia
	  - They seemd to have used the same strategy of hosting webpages in an iframe.
		  - I think they take an article name and automatically generate the html they want from it.
	  - [see this link](https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/play/wiki.php?article=Spanish_conquest_of_the_Inca_Empire) 
  - [thewikigame](https://www.thewikigame.com) seems to use a parser that returns raw html, which is inserted with JS.

This is intended to be run on a linux system.

----

## Completed:
- Cache all loaded files -> Store as JSON or as Files?
- Get Wikipedia content and parse it
- How to return content from function with expressjs?
- remove search boxes and extra stuff from page
- The main issue right now is that I am unable to detect when a link is clicked.
- Plan: Dynamically fetch wikipedia pages, and break out of the iframe to set variables.
- If I can host the page and the game, I shouldn't have issues with XSS
- Autogenerate [url](https://github.com/ElderINTERalliance/WikiRaces2021/blob/3d731bdac930a36299f17b73827c23e2dd1e2c54/src/game/game_static/client.js#L8)
- improve `if (err) return log.error(err);`
- set github language [with this](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-change-repo-language-in-github-c3e07819c5bb) [or this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34713765/github-changes-repository-to-wrong-language)
- create test suite
- due to xss, I cannot tell what url an iframe is on without hosting it.
